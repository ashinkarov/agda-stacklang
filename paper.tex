\section{Introduction}
Right now we have the following plan about the structure of the GPCE paper.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Goal: implementing DSL with dependent type system 
    \item Problem: current two approaches are either doing a deep embedding or
        implementing a typechecker from scratch
    \item Reflection to the rescue: we can use reflection for implementing
        custom compilers 
    \item Our approach by example: demonstrate that this actually works in Agda
        (ps example)
    \item Extracting definitions by pattern matching: matching on the stack
    \item Using normalization to get rid of meta-functions (by using this
        technique, you get macros for free! / or use rewrite rules example:
        exchange o exchange = id)
    \item General technology for writing extractors
    \item This actually scales to realistic and useful examples!
\end{enumerate}

Optional parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generating assertions
    \item Ensuring termination of recursive functions
\end{enumerate}
